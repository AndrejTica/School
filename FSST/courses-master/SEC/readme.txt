* There are different types of penetration tests that can be completed against a target. 

> white box penetration test
* when the ethical hackers have been provided with all available information about the subject they are testing. 

> black box penetration test is
* when the hackers have been provided no back-end information about the
target. The purpose of this penetration test is **to simulate as closely** as possible how a malicious attacker might attempt to compromise a target without insider knowledge.

> Gray Hat Hacker

systems weaknesses, without permission but without malicious intent. Their goal is to bring these flaws to the attention of the system owner so they can be corrected.

While no network is completely secure there are steps that can be taken to lessen risk thus making a network or system less of a target. This can be called reducing your attack surface. One way of doing this is by performing a penetration test and that is what Ethical Hackers do.
